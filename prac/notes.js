// prototylyal inheritance
//  functional programming (ie: closures)
//  supporting impertaitive/procedural programming. supports oop with protytal inheritance

// doesn't require number of arguments to match in funct definition. if number exceeds, they will be ingored. if less then, they have value unedfined
// The key to making this work is to capture the value of i at each pass through the for loop by passing it into a newly created function object
