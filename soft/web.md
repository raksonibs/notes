## Web isn't uniform
### Karolina Szczur
- web without JS is empty and broken
- While the percentage of these users might be relatively low, we fail to remember that until the scripts load, that scenario is true for all of us.
- The global connectedness is rapidly growing, but there’s still a vast space of unmapped territories 
- the foundation of the Web is plain ol’ Hyper Text Markup Language along with Cascading Style Sheets. I’m not suggesting we should stop using JavaScript at all—it’s a great language and the ecosystem is growing rapidly. 
- It’s a privilege to be able to use breaking edge technologies and devices, but let’s not forget basic accessibility and progressive enhancement. Ultimately, we’re building for the users, not for our own tastes or preferences. Sadly, not everyone is born with an equal chance.
-  In these completely irrelevant microaggressions we lose sight of the humans we build software for.
-  seemingly user-invisible decisions shape what the Web is. There’s no one programming language that will divide and conquer.
- the Web isn’t uniform—it’s countless flowing layers, each affecting user experiences in its own way.
- The Web can and will be built with and on anything we can put our hands on. Let’s not forget who we’re creating it for.
