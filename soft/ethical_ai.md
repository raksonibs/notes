## IEEE Conf
### AI 

- AI100 study standford
- mystification of AI: AI winter, deepmind, exitement
- tunnel idea in ethics: who to kill
- IEEE globbal ethics iniiative for deisgn of autonomous systems. 
- not a mandate of what someone should do, more bring a concern, practitioners a conduct here is how they address them
- european conferenc eon AI
- charter + standards, projects, details
-  rariefied AI. ai with body called robotics
- what should a robot do, quest to developr robots with ethics
- values into code
- in the beginnig robots were in boxes
- goal is to take them out of the boxes and want the human robot collobration to improve efficiency
- roboethics, robots ethics, robot's ethics
- limitation on some situation of robot ethics. it learns from conext and develops morality in robot's ethics (might not be the same one, can build the rule, way cooler)
- if had anser to what should.ought could design policy and technical implentations
- people don't want machines making decisions on life or death. voice of people important. 
* Questions with ORI. Understand life or death when killing for trustworthiness but what about this the same for healthcare, ie: watson diagnosing pneumatic cancer? 
- loss of capacity relates to autnomos agents
- dissimilating information 
- what should roboot do: far from clear. public acceptance and design descions, democatic approach to modal decisicons, delegaiting decision making to atmoic interactions
- not perspectivice, deliver insights not answers
- 

- aritifical autonomos agents
- agents that have autonomy and we build them
- no representation you can query
- formal methods for sepcificationa nd verifiaciton, hierirachal constatint based modular archetcitures, inferring human values, semi autonomy with human, participatory action design (wizard of oz)
- what we need: model agent strucutre and functionality, predict consquences of agent commands and actions, impose contrasints on agent actions such as goal reacahbility, safety and livelness, determine if an agent satifies those constrains
- formal methods: need tripartite thoery: language to express agent stucture and dnymics, language for constraintbased specifications, method to dermine if an agent will satisfy its specifications
- wnat to build particular robots, not general ones
- typically have layers of controllers
- pritorized constatins for hierichal modeular
- formal methods
- two end scales on specitrum are overshadowing the real concerns
- classicaly ethics only concerns with human agency
- sience of ethics will not resultin unified theory because science never done
-  john dewey: morality has roots in evolution, tool we use to design new forms of beneficial behavior. 
- philopsher's disease: set up two ends of ana rgument against the other that are reconicilbe. -> these type of talks are distracting
- mebeded ethics design: there can be no perfect moral agents, but what makes it moral is that it wants to behave better, not that it is always moral
- what kind of rights dow e infer, and what expectations do we have
-
